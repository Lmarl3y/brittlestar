    quote: "Was staying at the Midland and based on the good reviews booked for drinks and one of the platters on a Friday evening. As soon as we walked in we were welcomed by staff and took a seat at the bar to order drinks. Our table was a bit delayed but that was fine and as it was we ended up staying seated at the bar. There was live music which was great. The drinks were reasonably priced and the platter of cheese and charcuterie we had were amazing. You can see the care and attention they put into the food and the service. Would thoroughly recommend this place and wish we lived nearer. Thanks to all the staff - a great experience over all.",

Anna was on her own tonight but was very attentive to all the guests either drinking or eating. Cocktails were great and the Camembert, baked potato and meat platter were delicious. You did a great job, Anna, Thank you. I'd recommend a visit!",
